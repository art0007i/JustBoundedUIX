Just Bounded UIX
===========

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) adds gizmo bounding boxes to UIX elements,
as well as fixing UIX elements breaking when a parent is inserted.

- Incompatible with the [original mod](https://github.com/Banane9/NeosBoundedUIX/)!

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [BoundedUIX.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/JustBoundedUIX/releases/latest/download/BoundedUIX.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
